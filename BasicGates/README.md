# Welcome!

The basic gates kata covers the basic operations (a.k.a. "gates") used in quantum computing, as well as the concept of controlled and adjoint versions of gates.

You can [run the BasicGates kata as a Jupyter Notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/master?filepath=BasicGates%2FBasicGates.ipynb)!

#### Theory

* A list of most common gates can be found in [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate).
* [Quirk](http://algassert.com/quirk) is a convenient tool for visualizing the effect of gates on qubit states.

#### Q# materials

* Basic gates provided in Q# belong to the `Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic` namespace and are listed [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.intrinsic).
* Using controlled and adjoint versions of gates is covered in the Q# documentation on [operation types](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/language/type-model#operation-and-function-types).
* Defining controlled and adjoint versions of gates is covered in the Q# documentation on [operation definitions](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/language/file-structure#operation-declarations).
