    .SYNOPSIS
        This script validates katas represented as Jupyter notebooks.

    .NOTES
        A kata is validated as follows: 
          * corresponding Jupyter notebook is copied into a "Check.ipynb",
          * %kata magic is replaced with %check_kata magic that runs 
            the tasks with their reference implementations instead of the stubs.
          * if the execution of the notebook with %check_kata magic fails,
            the validation of the kata fails.

    .PARAMETER Notebook
        Path to the notebook to be validated.
        If not set, defaults to validating all notebooks in the current directory.

# List of Notebooks that can't be validated for various reasons:
#  * Check.ipynb is a validation artifact and not an actual kata notebook.
#  * CHSH and MagicSquare games require implementing two code cells at once before running the test, 
#    so the first of the cells implemented is guaranteed to fail.
#  * GraphColoring and SolveSATWithGrover have tasks for which the correct solution fails or times out with relatively high probability.
